## About the Montana Computing Consortium

The *Montana Computing Consortium* (MCC) unites colleges and universities 
across Montana and the Northern Rocky Mountain region to strengthen 
computing education, research, and workforce development. Founded to address 
the state’s growing demand for qualified computing professionals and educators, 
MCC fosters collaboration among institutions to expand access to 
high-quality computer science programs. 

Through shared teaching, mentoring, and scholarship initiatives, 
the consortium empowers students—especially those from low-income and 
rural communities—to pursue computing degrees and careers in Montana. 
By connecting educators, researchers, and learners statewide, 
MCC is building a sustainable network to train the next generation of 
computer scientists and computing teachers who will drive innovation 
and opportunity across Big Sky Country.
