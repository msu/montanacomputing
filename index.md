# Welcome to the Montana Computing Consortium

The Montana Computing Consortium (MCC) brings together colleges and 
universities across Montana to expand access to computer science education 
and strengthen the state’s tech workforce.

By connecting educators, students, and institutions, 
MCC supports hands-on teaching, mentorship, and career opportunities that 
prepare the next generation of computing professionals to live 
and work in Montana.

If you are interested in finding out more about current computer science 
programs and degrees at institutions throughout Montana, please visit the
